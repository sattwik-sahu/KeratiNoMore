# KeratiNoMore

IISER Bhopal [iGEM 2023](https://igem.org/) Wiki

## Description

Feathers are largely produced as a waste byproduct at poultry plants. In recent years, especially,
the development of the poultry industry has resulted in a large accumulation of feather keratin
resources, which seriously pollute the environment. Usage of conventional approaches to feather
degradation, like hydrothermal and chemical methods, are inefficient and consume large amounts
of energy. Feather degrading bacteria (FDB) provide a promising alternative to degrade feather
waste. We derive motivation from these feather degrading bacteria, which can efficiently degrade
feathers to products with high amino acid content. Characterisation of feather degradation
mechanism into disulphide bond reduction and proteolysis has helped us enhance our
understanding of this elusive process. Deducing from the fact that sulphitolysis is an
indispensable part of feather degradation, we plan to utilise enzymes involved in the L-Cysteine
metabolic pathway for the same. We intend to devise two distinct recombinant strains of Bacillus
subtilis 168 to make an efficient feather degradation system. The products thus formed are rich in
amino acids and can serve as feed supplement. In this way, we intend to tackle this problem of
feather pollution by providing a sustainable solution which captures the idea of a circular
economy.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

You need to have [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en) installed on your system

### Installing

- Clone the repo
  ```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/sattwik-sahu/KeratiNoMore keratinomore
  ```
- `cd` into the repo folder

  ```bash
  $ cd keratinomore
  ```

- Install the required `npm` dependencies (You need to have NodeJS installed for this step)

  ```bash
  $ npm install
  ```

### Preview

- `build` to generate static files in `dist` folder

  ```bash
  $ npm run build
  ```

- `preview` to start the preview server

  ```bash
  $ npm run preview
  ```

- Open the local URL generated, in your browser. It will be in the format <br />`http://localhost:<some number>/`

### Development

- To run the dev server

  ```bash
  $ npm run dev
  ```

- Open the URL generated, in your browser
- Now you can start editing files in the repo to see the changes real-time using hot-module replacement (HMR)
